Whooops, sorry I didn't update this on time today (Wednesday).

Thursday's lesson is on [Dictionaries](/lessons/dictionaries). Remember to do the 
reading.

Friday we'll review and have an assessment and a short day (!)
=======
Great work everybody on the assessment!

Have a great weekend. To cut into that a bit 
I've prepared this [homework](/homework/week-2-playground). I do hope
it's at least a little fun. 

Also don't forget to read up on [functions](/lessons/functions-one), the
subject of Monday's lesson.

Welcome back, and welcome to Hunters Point Plaza at 
47-40 21st St, Long Island City, NY 11101, top floor.

The reading is basically the same for [tomorrow](/lessons/functions-two), in terms
of what to read but we'll cover more of it and it'll probably mean more to you another
time around.
